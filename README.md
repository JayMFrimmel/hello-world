Intro: 
I am hopeful this class will lead me to a new career that will be fulfilling.  I have just left a 15 year career as a public school librarian, mostly with middle schoolers.  This will be a challenge that I plan to do well in.
Update 7/5/2016:) I have finished my summer travels by visiting my family in St. Augustine, Florida. I had a lovely time catching up with my mother (age 82) and my dad (age 88). Thankfully it wasn't too hot.
